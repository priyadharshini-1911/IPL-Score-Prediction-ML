By analyzing features like run rate and team performance, the model provides insights into likely outcomes as a match progresses.

Algorithms used:

Linear Regression
K-Nearest Neighbor Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
RandomForest Regressor
SVR
Decision Tree Regressor
Hyperparamter Optimization:

Used optuna for paramter optimization.

Dataset:

The dataset comprises of over by over details of matches and runs from 2008 to 2020.
